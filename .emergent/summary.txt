The previous AI engineer began by clarifying MVP priorities for the SecuHire AI-Driven Fake Interview Detection System, focusing on Candidate Portal, AI Monitoring, then Company Portal, with Google Gemini for AI. An initial Candidate Portal was built and tested, revealing AI monitoring had WebSocket issues and lacked a Gemini API key. A major pivot occurred when the user redefined Phase 1 as a comprehensive ATS + CRM for recruiters, leading to a complete rebuild of the backend and frontend. After successfully implementing the ATS, rebranding to SecuHire with a vibrant theme was requested and executed. The user then re-introduced the need for a Candidate Portal, leading to the development of a dual-user system with comprehensive authentication. The engineer then provided a detailed overview of the complete platform. Currently, the engineer is actively implementing critical security features: tab switching prevention, unauthorized resource access blocking, and screen monitoring/locking during interviews, which were identified as missing from the original requirements.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build SecuHire, an AI-Driven Fake Interview Detection System. Initially, the system aimed for a candidate portal with AI-monitored online testing (tab switching prevention, unauthorized resource blocking, real-time facial/behavioral monitoring), a company portal (job posting, application tracking), and AI validation (malpractice detection). However, a significant pivot redefined Phase 1 as a comprehensive Applicant Tracking System (ATS) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) for recruiters/companies. This new Phase 1 includes recruiter sign-up/login, job posting/application management, resume parsing, pipeline management (screening to hired), email sync, notes, reminders, and an analytics dashboard. Later, a candidate portal was reintroduced, requiring secure login, job browsing, interview attendance, and email/phone OTP verification. The system must also incorporate AI-powered security (fraud detection, behavioral analysis, identity verification) and critical monitoring technologies like facial/eye movement tracking, and unauthorized activity flagging. The current focus is on implementing tab switching prevention, unauthorized resource blocking, and screen monitoring during interviews.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack Development:** React.js (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
- **UI/UX:** Shadcn UI components, Tailwind CSS, Glass-morphism, responsive design.
- **Authentication:** JWT for role-based access, Email/Phone OTP verification.
- **AI Integration:** Google Gemini (via ) for AI monitoring.
- **Document Processing:** PyPDF2 for resume parsing.
- **Database Best Practices:** UUIDs for IDs, timezone-aware datetime handling.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>

- **/app/backend/server.py**: Main FastAPI application. Initially built for a candidate portal, it was completely rewritten for the ATS+CRM, then further extended for dual authentication (recruiters and candidates), verification, and AI monitoring endpoints. Handles routing, database interactions, and business logic.
- **/app/backend/requirements.txt**: Python dependencies.  was added for AI integration, and  for resume parsing.
- **/app/backend/.env**: Contains  and .
- **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: Main React component and central router. This file underwent multiple significant rewrites. It manages the dual authentication system, routing for both recruiter (ATS/CRM) and candidate portals, handles UI state, and integrates various components. It also contains the branding and styling logic.
- **/app/frontend/src/App.css**: Global styles and Tailwind CSS directives. Modified multiple times to implement the vibrant professional SecuHire branding with gradients, glass-morphism, and color palettes.
- **/app/frontend/src/components/ui/**: Collection of Shadcn UI components used throughout the application for consistent design.
- **New Components (e.g., ,  - implied)**: Created to handle candidate-specific authentication flows and dashboard functionalities.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **AI Monitoring Issues**:
    - WebSocket connectivity issues for real-time AI analysis.
    - Google Gemini API key needs to be provided (though a placeholder exists).
    - Actual facial detection and behavioral analysis are not yet working.
- **Interview Attendance System**: Implement the secure video interface for interviews.
- **Complete Verification Flow**: Integrate actual email/SMS services for verification.
- **Enhanced Job Matching**: Implement AI-powered job recommendations.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with implementing critical security features for the interview system. These include:
1.  **Tab switching prevention**: To ensure candidates cannot switch tabs during an online assessment.
2.  **Unauthorized resource access blocking**: To prevent candidates from accessing external resources during an interview.
3.  **Screen monitoring and locking during interviews**: To enforce a secure environment and prevent malpractice.

The engineer acknowledged that these were critical missing features from the original requirements and explicitly stated, Let me implement these **critical security features** right now. The last few messages indicate that the engineer has started implementing these changes, likely within the frontend components related to the interview process, as indicated by the successful edits to files.

<optional_next_step>
Continue implementing tab switching prevention, unauthorized resource access blocking, and screen monitoring/locking for interviews.
